A personal ranker that allows you to rank and sort your own Top 9 for the international survival show Chuang Asia: Thailand. It currently has functionality for adding and removing trainees on the table through click, sorting them on the ranking itself through drag & drop, and activating filters that show which contestants have been eliminated or currently hold a top 9 position. It is also possible to save a link of your current ranking to revisit it as the episodes progress.
